                    <div class="why-ind-cnt">
                        <p>Saudi Arabia is geographically well positioned as a country to create a
new digitalized global city, that will be situated at the crossroad of
three continents Asia, Europe and Africa with half the world's
population accessible within a five-hour flight. The country is already
a key state in the MENAT region. Saudi Arabia spends Billions per year
in ICT investment and that doesn't account for
the corporate and foreign investment the Kingdom's digital revolution
attracts.</p>
                        <p>As a key regional leader in the development of next generation
solutions and technology, the country presents lucrative investment
opportunities for international investors. Technologies such as 5G
Mobile Networks, BIM, 3D Printing, BAS, ITS, Smart Energy
Management Systems, Smart Metering, Renewable Energy,
Fintech, Artificial intelligence, Virtual Reality, Robotics,
Autonomous Vehicles, Drones, Biometrics and Low-cost space
exploration and micro-satellites will play a very vital role in the
development of smart and sustainable cities across Saudi Arabia.</p>

											</div>
											<div class="col-md-8">
												<p>Robert Katz is probably the most influential technology futurist that you have never heard of.  As a young scientific and engineering pioneer, Robert conceived, designed, and deployed many of the world’s most game-changing connectivity capabilities, all of which we take for granted as being ubiquitously commonplace today.  These include the world’s first global email platform, the world’s first GPS trackers, and the world’s first remote monitors.  His M2M tracking and monitoring systems were the forefather of IoT, which eventually paved the way for what we call Smart Cities today.

													He was further pivotal in systems development for OnStar vehicle navigation, Mars rovers, geo-spatial search-and-rescue services, climate change mapping, Hubble Space Telescope science missions, and the Star Wars Missile Defense system, including its Iron Dome follow-on.
													
													 
													
													Robert enjoys delivering win-win, public-private-people-partnerships for collaboration among governments, corporations, laboratories, investors, and developers.  As a homeland, national, and cyber security strategist, and matchmaker, he counts NASA, CIA, NGA, FBI, DHS, NIST, NOAA, DoD, DoJ, and Johns Hopkins as among his most noteworthy clients.  For each, his trademark SOLUTIONeering™ approach quelled complexity and conquered chaos, providing a detailed roadmap to navigating their most pressing challenges.
													
													 
													
													He diligently creates, architects, and leads multi-disciplinary teams for complex commercial, intelligence, and military C5ISR programs.  These included contracts ranging from the Pentagon half-billion-dollar US Cyber Command support activity to the DHS $6 billion continuous data monitoring (CDM) deployment.
													
													 
													
													While not bolstering national security, Robert supports community security.  He proudly volunteers first-hand as an operator, leader, and instructor for teams of firefighters, paramedics, and technical specialists in rescue domains which include tactical medicine, underwater dive, swift water, high angle rope, confined space, and hazardous materials.
													
													His Innovation Intelligence™ book series will soon launch with its inaugural publication: SOLUTIONneering™: The Robust & Rigorous Roadmap to Re-Innovate Innovation, Re-Start Start-Ups, and Re-Engineer Entrepreneurship.  There Robert focuses on crafting creative solutions through systematic problem solving and, above all, valuing the true sparks of a country’s innovation: its people.
													
													 
													
													Robert continues to proudly serve as the CEO & Executive Director of the World Innovation Network (WIN).  As the preeminent 501(s)(3) Non-profit NGO innovation think tank, WIN remains laser-focused on heightening innovation within the tech-triad of cyber-space, outer-space, and cyber-space to heighten national security.</p>
